# Federalist-Paper-Authorship-Dispute

The Federalist Papers were a series of eighty-five essays urging the citizens of New York to ratify the new United States Constitution.
Written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, the essays originally appeared anonymously in New York newspapers in 1787 and
1788 under the pen name "Publius." A bound edition of the essays was first published in 1788, but it was not until the 1818 edition
published by the printer Jacob Gideon that the authors of each essay were identified by name. The Federalist Papers are considered one of
the most important sources for interpreting and understanding the original intent of the Constitution. In the author column, you will find
74 essays with identified authors: 51 essays written by Hamilton, 15 by Madison, 3 by Hamilton and Madison, 5 by Jay. The remaining 11
essays, however, is authored by “Hamilton or Madison”. These are the famous essays with disputed authorship. Hamilton wrote to claim the
authorship before he was killed in a duel. Later Madison also claimed authorship. Historians were trying to find out which one was the real
author.

The analysis provided in this study will use k-means clustering technique to determine who wrote the disputed papers.

Even though the techniques used here provide some conclusion as to who wrote which paper, one cannot speak to the accuracy of these results. Hence, different approaches and techniques need to be applied to this data to compare the various results. Even if other techniques could identify the authorship, one will never know the accuracy of it unless the authors themselves tell the truth. However, the above techniques were useful and helped gather some insights that could be more valuable if clubbed with more data or techniques. Another suggestion to try would be to remove the papers written by Jay to see if that helps to form better clusters. It would also be interesting to mine other books or papers written by the two authors to ascertain their style of writing and usage of words which in turn would help to analyze these federalist papers better.

The idea of using cluster analysis for text analysis developed from the pioneering work done by Mosteller and Wallace in the 1960’s. They
analyzed the frequency distributions of high frequency words in the Federalist papers to draw their conclusions. An important observation
to note from their work is the fact that they not only used statistics but involved domain experts in their studies to get different
insights. Hence, further refinement of our analysis using Mosteller’s work will be imperative in finding more conclusive and accurate
results.
